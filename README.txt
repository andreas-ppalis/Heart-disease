### Project Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze a heart disease prediction dataset. The goal of the assignment is to predict whether someone will suffer from a heart attack. 

The dataset(heart.csv) includes information on:
- age
- sex
- cp (chest pain)
- trestbps (resting blood pressure)
- cholesterol
- fbs (fasting blood pressure)
- restecg (resting electrocardiographiv results: 0,1,2)
- thalach (maximum heart rate achieved during exercise)
- exang (exercise induced angina)
- oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (measured in mm))
- slope (The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (values 0, 1, 2))
- ca number of major vessels (0-3) coloured by fluoroscopy
- thal (Thalassemia - blood disorder)
- target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence of heart disease)

Workings in the project:
- Summary statistics for main variables of the dataset
- Correlations between variables
- Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to predict outcomes
